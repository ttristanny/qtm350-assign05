# Introduction

This report analyzes a 2022 snapshot from the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset [@worldbank_wdi].
We focus on a subset of indicators (GDP per capita, life expectancy, inflation, unemployment, exports share, and primary school enrolment) across countries.
All code is executed within Quarto and hidden in the final rendering. See the accompanying Reveal.js slides for a condensed presentation.


# Data loading {#sec-data}

::: {.callout-note}
**Source.** The data come from the World Bank WDI API, saved locally as `wdi.csv` (217 rows × 14 columns in the provided sample).
:::

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Read data (expects wdi.csv in working directory)
df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")

# Standardize column names just in case
df.columns = [c.strip().lower().replace(" ", "_") for c in df.columns]

# Keep a small working subset of indicators (feel free to expand)
keep = [
    "country",
    "gdp_per_capita",
    "life_expectancy",
    "inflation_rate",
    "unemployment_rate",
    "exports_gdp_share",
    "primary_school_enrolment_rate",
    "total_population"
]
available = [c for c in keep if c in df.columns]
df = df[available].copy()

# Basic cleaning: drop rows missing both GDP per capita and life expectancy
df = df.dropna(subset=[c for c in ["gdp_per_capita", "life_expectancy"] if c in df.columns])
df.head()
```

The table describes the retained variables, and the figure previews a key relationship we analyze below.

# Exploratory data analysis

## Summary statistics {#sec-summary}

```{python}
import numpy as np
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics for selected indicators."


summary = df.describe(include="all").T
summary = summary[["count","mean","std","min","25%","50%","75%","max"]]
summary
```


Key takeaways:
- Wide dispersion in **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy** indicates heterogeneity across income levels.
- **Inflation** and **unemployment** vary considerably; distributions are right‑skewed in many cases.
- Countries with higher **exports share** often (not always) have higher income.

## Relationships between indicators

We examine three relationships:
1. Income and health: GDP per capita vs. life expectancy.
2. Macroeconomic environment: Inflation vs. unemployment.
3. Human capital and income: Primary school enrolment vs. GDP per capita.

```{python}
corrs = {}
for pair in [
    ("gdp_per_capita", "life_expectancy"),
    ("inflation_rate", "unemployment_rate"),
    ("primary_school_enrolment_rate", "gdp_per_capita")
]:
    x, y = pair
    if x in df.columns and y in df.columns:
        corrs[f"{x} ~ {y}"] = float(df[[x, y]].dropna().corr().iloc[0,1])
corrs
```

# Visualizations

## GDP per capita vs. life expectancy

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,5))
x = df["gdp_per_capita"]
y = df["life_expectancy"]
ax.scatter(x, y, alpha=0.7)
ax.set_xlabel("GDP per capita (current US$)")
ax.set_ylabel("Life expectancy at birth (years)")
ax.set_title("Income and health: GDP per capita vs Life expectancy")
plt.tight_layout()
```


## Top 10 countries by GDP per capita (bar chart)

```{python}
top = df.dropna(subset=["gdp_per_capita"]).nlargest(10, "gdp_per_capita")
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5))
ax.barh(top["country"], top["gdp_per_capita"])
ax.invert_yaxis()
ax.set_xlabel("GDP per capita (current US$)")
ax.set_title("Top 10 countries by GDP per capita, 2022")
plt.tight_layout()
```

# Cross‑references in context

As shown in Figure, income is positively associated with health outcomes.
The distributional context from Table provides useful bounds for interpreting typical versus extreme values.

# Conclusion

We presented a short 2022 profile using WDI. The analysis suggests strong links between income and health, and heterogeneous macro conditions.
All materials are reproducible in Quarto. See @quarto_doc for authoring and cross‑referencing conventions.
